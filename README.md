### Meet PopAI the artificial intelligence that helps you detect bias in your news reading behavior

In the past 48 hours we had our PopAI read thousands of news articles from different news sorces.
By looking at millions of words and analyzing in which context they are being used, the PopAI now understands the semantics of words. Given a news article, it has learned to extract its semantics and to predict if the article is biased.

If the news article contains images, the PopAI bias prediction is supported by the clarifai API which we have trained to detect political bias in images.

PopAI combines the power of deep learning for text analysis with clarifai's cutting-edge computer vision technology.
