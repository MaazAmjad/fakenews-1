# POP!   --- Burst your Bubble

This past election has made it abundantly clear that we live in very isolated bubbles, reinforced by social media like Facebook and Twitter. At this point, it seems like there is little base of shared knowledge on which to have political discussion. Since the election, there has been a lot of talk of not only blatantly fake news, but the much more pervasive and insidious *biased news*. Visualizations like the Wall Street Journal’s [Red vs. Blue Facebook feed](http://graphics.wsj.com/blue-feed-red-feed/) highlight how different both sides see the world.
 
Until election day, many didn’t even realize how isolated we are. Well, we think it’s time to *pop* our bubbles.

### We introduce the POP chrome extension

The POP chrome extension can track what news articles you’ve been reading and automatically detect if they are biased left or right. Over time, POP can help you keep tabs on how one-sided the news you’ve been reading is.

### Powered by PopAI, the artificial intelligence that detects bias in your news reading behavior

In the past 48 hours, we had our PopAI read thousands of news articles from different news sources. By looking at millions of words and analyzing the context in which they’re used, PopAI now understands the meaning of words. Given a news article, it has learned to extract its meaning and predict bias. If the news article contains images, PopAI’s bias prediction is augmented by a Clarifai model trained to detect political bias in images.
 
PopAI combines the power of deep learning for text analysis with Clarifai's cutting-edge computer vision technology.
